# Exploring Software Development Tools

Welcome to Exploring Software Development Tools, a focused guide to the command-line utilities and development environments that form the foundation of modern software engineering. This site is part of the [BradPenney.io](https://bradpenney.io) learning ecosystem.

Every software developer builds on a stack of tools—version control systems, text editors, build automation, data transformation utilities, and more. These tools aren't just conveniences; they're force multipliers that transform how we write, test, and deploy software. Yet many developers learn these tools organically, picking up commands and flags through trial and error, never fully grasping the underlying concepts that make them powerful.

This site takes a different approach. Rather than presenting scattered tips and tricks, each tool is explored systematically: what it does, why it matters, how it works, and how to use it effectively in real-world scenarios.

## What You'll Find Here

This site covers essential development tools organized by category:

**Version Control**

- Git fundamentals and advanced workflows
- Configuration strategies across projects
- Branching models and collaboration patterns

**Text Editors**

- NeoVim (Neovim) setup and philosophy
- Modal editing concepts
- Extensibility through Lua

**Data Processing**

- JSON manipulation with `jq`
- YAML processing with `yq`
- Command-line data transformation patterns

**Build Automation**

- Makefiles and build systems
- Task automation workflows
- Dependency management

**Command-Line Utilities**

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for workflow automation
- Shell scripting best practices
- Productivity multipliers

## Who This Is For

Whether you're a student learning development workflows, a professional sharpening your toolkit, or a hobbyist exploring the command line, you'll find structured, practical content here. Each article balances conceptual understanding with hands-on examples, bridging the gap between "what this tool does" and "why you should care."

## Philosophy

These tools share a common thread: they prioritize composability, automation, and precision. Understanding them deeply changes how you approach software development. A developer fluent in Git doesn't just track changes—they craft meaningful history. A developer comfortable with `jq` doesn't just parse JSON—they transform data streams. A developer skilled with NeoVim doesn't just edit text—they orchestrate their development environment.

The goal isn't mastery of every flag and option (that's what man pages are for). The goal is understanding the mental models these tools embody, so you can use them intentionally and effectively.

Thanks for visiting. Let's build something.
