# Welcome to Exploring Software Development Tools

A subsection of [BradPenney.io](https://bradpenney.io), this is a friendly guide through the world of command-line magic and automation awesomeness! 🧰🚀

This site is dedicated to documenting the best practices, quirks, and superpowers of tools like `git`, `jq`, `yq`, `make`, `gh` and other must-haves for developers who want to do more with less typing (and fewer headaches).

Whether you’re just getting started or you’ve been piping output into `/dev/null` for years, I hope you’ll find something here that’s helpful, insightful, or at least good for a smirk. 😄

## Topics to Explore 🔍

- Version control with `git` and helpful branching workflows 🌳
- Slicing and dicing JSON and YAML with `jq` and `yq` 🪓
- Automating builds and scripts with `make` ⚙️
- Tips, tricks, and tiny CLI power moves ⚡
- Real-world examples and shell-fu 🧠

Stick around — I’ll keep adding more tools, tutorials, and tangents.
Thanks for visiting, and happy hacking! 👋
