# What is Git?

Git is a version control system. It tracks changes to text files, so any changes that are made
by authors can be reverted at any time.  Its the ideal tool for software developers to
collaborate together to create a unified software product.

There is an excellent book - [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) - that is
available for free online.  The goal of this information isn't to replace that book, but rather
to simply share some of the commands and tools I find useful when working with Git.
